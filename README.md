# conjurer
A program that can test and generate elementary number theory conjectures in bulk.
##How does it work?
The general conjecture statement of a conjurer conjecture is "All naturals of the form A can be written in the form B". 
These forms are represented as expression trees internally. A conjecture is formed by connecting one form to another.
